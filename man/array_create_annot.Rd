\usage{
array_create_annot(platform, collapsing = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{platform}{Affymetrix/Agilent platform annotation database as returned
by the \code{array_platform_selector()} function.}

\item{collapsing}{Boolean flag to choose whether to collapse by unique Probe
ID in the case of annotation packages from Bioconductor
(GPL records from GEO are already collapsed).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing for each probe of the platform a number of
features as selected by the user.
}
\description{
This function retrieves gene annotation for a given microarray
platform and returns them as a data frame. As input, it requires
a database name as returned by \code{array_platform_selector()}.
This function uses \pkg{svDialogs} package to implement a
minimal graphical interface allowing the user to select the
number and the type of features to be used as annotation.
GPL-based annotation are retrieved from GEO using
\code{GEOquery::getGEO()} function that needs a working FTP
connection.
