\title{Different Non-Unique Elements}
\usage{
dnues(vec)
}
\arguments{
\item{vec}{A vector to be scanned for duplicates.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of two elements, namely the number of different
non-unique elements, and the global number of non-unique entries in
\code{vec}.
}
\description{
A function that tells how many \emph{different non-unique} elements
there are in a given vector. Unlike \code{base::duplicated()} that
detects duplicated entries \emph{after} their first occurrence, this
function looks at \emph{all} non-unique values. \code{NA}s are ignored by
default.
}
\examples{
# How many different non-unique Gene Symbols are there in DEGs_expr data set?
dnues(DEGs_expr$GeneSymbol)
}
